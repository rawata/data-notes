# Notes
General professional notes on working with data. There are generally 3 levels you can reach on a data with sufficient depth. 

### 1. Truth
This is record level facts about data, You can select, project & filter to see what data is about and if you are interested in you can have a close look at the individual records. Mostly you would use sql, or simple text wrangling to get understanding at this level.

### 2. Deeper Truths
This is about aggregated data: sum, max, median, percentile, in-degree, out-degree etc. You are no more interested in individual records but in deeper statistics about the population as a whole.

### 3. Revelations
This is what's hidden beneath the numbers, usually uncovered by deep statistical and machine learning algorithms. e.g important customers based on their contributions esp if contributions are bit subjective. you can't just take sum of number of contributions as the measure of importance, you also need to assess the quality of contributions
